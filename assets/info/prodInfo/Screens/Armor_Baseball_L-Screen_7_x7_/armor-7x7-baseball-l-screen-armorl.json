  "description": "The Armor Series 7’ x 7’ baseball L screen comes with a foam and vinyl wrapped black powder-coated steel frame. The foam and vinyl allow schools and teams to outfit their baseball net with their organization’s color. Most importantly, the foam and vinyl wrap drastically decrease deflection when the baseball makes contact with the pitching net frame. In today’s game, most players are taking batting practice from distances around thirty feet which increases the chances of a violent deflection. Furthermore, the foam and vinyl will increase the lifespan of the pitching net because it prevents the baseball from pinching the net between the ball and frame. WARNING: This screen is intended to protect the pitcher or nearby players during batting practice or practice drills. However, it is possible a batted ball may ricochet off the screen and hit the batter or a nearby player, causing serious injury or even death. Batters, pitchers, and nearby players should always wear appropriate protective equipment while using this product.
