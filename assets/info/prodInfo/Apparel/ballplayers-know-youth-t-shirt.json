  "description": "The Ballplayers Know Youth T-Shirt is the ultimate choice for young athletes, offering a blend of performance and comfort. Made from 5-Star Fabric, this 4.0 oz micro poly interlock is designed for durability and all-season wear, featuring moisture-wicking technology to keep kids cool and dry. With a rash guard design, it ensures smooth, irritation-free protection, while its stain release and odor-resistant properties promise long-lasting freshness. The shirt is built to withstand the rigors of active play with fade and snag resistance, reinforced seams, and double needle stitching. Plus, the 44+ UPF provides essential UV protection, and its ultra-tight knit construction enhances coverage and printability for a polished look. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/176315\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
