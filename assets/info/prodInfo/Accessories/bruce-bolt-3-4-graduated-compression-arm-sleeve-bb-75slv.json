  "description": "Introducing our NEW 3/4 length graduated compression Premium Arm Sleeves, designed to elevate your game by increasing blood flow and decreasing muscle vibration. Just like our ORIGINAL full-length sleeves, these 3/4 sleeves help you THROW HARDER, LONGER by dilating arteries and compressing veins, ensuring your arm feels “live” throughout the game. Experience the dual benefits of enhanced performance and injury prevention, as our sleeves reduce muscle and tendon vibration during throws, keeping everything in place to minimize potential injuries. Plus, enjoy FASTER RECOVERY post-game by wearing the sleeve for an hour to boost oxygen delivery and lactic acid removal, leaving your arm feeling cool, fresh, and ready for the next challenge. table {\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  table-layout: fixed;\n}\n\ntable caption {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  margin: .5em 0 .75em;\n}\n\ntable tr {\n  background-color: #FFFFFF;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  padding: .35em;\n}\n\ntable th,\ntable td {\n  padding: .625em .35em;\n  text-align: left;\n}\n\ntable th {\n  font-size: .5em;\n  letter-spacing: .07em;\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  table {\n    border: 0;\n  }\n\n  table caption {\n    font-size: 1.3em;\n  }\n  \n  table thead {\n    border: none;\n    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);\n    height: 1px;\n    margin: -1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding: 0;\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 1px;\n  }\n  \n  table tr {\n    border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;\n    display: ;\n    margin-bottom: .625em;\n  }\n  \n  table td {\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;\n    display: ;\n    font-size: .8em;\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n  \n\n  \n  table td:last-child {\n    border-bottom: 0;\n  }\n} Height Weight Size 4'8-5'2 60-115 Youth 5'3-5'9 115-170 Small/Medium 5'10-6'2 170-215 Large/XL 6'3-6'9 215-270 XXL Height Weight Size 4'8-5'2 60-115 Youth 5'3-5'9 115-170 Small/Medium 5'10-6'2 170-215 Large/XL 6'3-6'9 215-270 XXL Height Weight Size Height",
