  "description": "The BRUCE BOLT Premium Pine Tar Stick is a game-changer for baseball players seeking the tackiest, longest-lasting grip enhancement available. This premium blend of real pine tar and rosin ensures optimal grip in all conditions, eliminating the need for messy sprays, rosin rubs, or towels. Simply apply it between your bat handle and barrel, with or without gloves, and enjoy a grip that lasts an entire tournament, maintaining its stickiness even when dirty. The innovative \"no mess\" plastic push-up applicator with a screw-on top keeps the pine tar fresh and sticky, preventing the common issues of drying out or becoming gooey in the heat. Plus, it boasts that classic pine tar aroma, enhancing your game with every swing. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/140076\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
