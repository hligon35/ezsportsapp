  "description": "Safeguard your leg at the plate with the EvoShield Custom Pro-SRZ 2.0 Extended Leg Guard, designed for players of all skill levels seeking superior protection. Featuring innovative Gel-to-Shell® Technology, this leg guard offers a custom fit by transforming from a flexible material to form-fitting shields in just 30 minutes. Extending 14 inches up the lead leg and covering the inside ankle, it provides comprehensive protection against foul balls and pitches in the dirt, while an additional shield on the top of the foot ensures extra coverage. Its lightweight, ergonomic design follows the leg's contours, allowing for unrestricted movement, while iridescent accents and a 3D cloud mesh base enhance both appearance and comfort in the batter’s box. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/167445\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
