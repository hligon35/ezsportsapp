These sleeves increase blood flow and reduce muscle vibration, helping you play, practice, and train harder and longer. Protect against sliding rash on your knees and shins while enjoying the freedom to wear your preferred sock and shoe combination. Benefit from faster muscle recovery post-game with the aid of graduated compression, which removes lactic acid and boosts oxygen delivery.
