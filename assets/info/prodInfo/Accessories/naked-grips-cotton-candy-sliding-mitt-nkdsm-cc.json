  "description": "The Cotton Candy Sliding Mitt from Naked Grips is your ultimate game-day companion, offering a blend of style and protection that's \"sooooo sweet, so clean.\" Designed with a structurally reinforced construction, this mitt stands out with its deliberately stiff build, providing superior protection compared to the competition's softer designs. Featuring premium neoprene, it ensures lightweight, breathable comfort, while the flexible vinyl strap allows for a customized fit. The dual-layered hand pad shells offer extra protection against cleats and agrilime scrapes, and its easy-on, easy-off design makes transitioning to base running a breeze. Pair it with the matching Cotton Candy bat grip and batting gloves, and carry all your essentials in the custom tote for a complete, stylish look on the field. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/166994\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
