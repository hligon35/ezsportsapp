  "description": "The Oakley Holbrook XL Matte Black/Prizm Black Polarized Sunglasses bring the iconic style of the Holbrook to those with larger faces, featuring a scaled-up design that includes a distinctive keyhole bridge and metal rivets. Crafted from lightweight O Matter frame material, these sunglasses ensure durability and all-day comfort while maintaining precise optical alignment with their Three-Point Fit system. The Prizm lenses are engineered to enhance color, contrast, and detail, providing an optimized visual experience, while the HDPolarized technology minimizes glare. Additionally, the Plutonite lens material offers superior UV protection, filtering out 100% of UVA, UVB, and some harmful blue light, and the HDO Optics deliver crystal clear vision and meet rigorous optical and impact standards. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/164951\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
