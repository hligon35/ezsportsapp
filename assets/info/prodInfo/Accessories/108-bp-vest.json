  "description": "The 108 BP Vest is revolutionizing the way hitters and pitchers train by addressing common issues like flying open, failing to get to the front side, and not rotating properly. This innovative training tool requires no verbal cues—simply put it on, pull the band, and watch as athletes achieve personal records effortlessly. The secret lies in understanding how force is applied to the ground, similar to how a punch impacts a punching bag; it's all about the force you generate. By focusing on upper body control, the vest helps athletes harness their energy more effectively, leading to improved balance and performance. Perfect for both bullpens and batting practice, the 108 BP Vest is a multi-use tool that not only trains but also exposes and corrects players' bad habits with dynamic resistance. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/166278\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
