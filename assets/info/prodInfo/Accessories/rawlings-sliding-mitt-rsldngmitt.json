This innovative mitt features a revolutionary three-piece design, combining neoprene, TPE, and a monoflex carbon fiber plate to ensure elite safety without compromising flexibility. Say goodbye to finger jams with its TPE energy-absorbing structure that locks out fingers to prevent hyperextension, while the asymmetrically flexible monoflex plate ensures the mitt bends just one way for added protection. Enjoy a comfortable, universal fit with the neoprene sleeve, providing both cushioning and a secure grip for any base-stealing situation. Available in multiple colors, the Rawlings Sliding Mitt is perfect for any player ready to make their mark on the field. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/176236\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
