Its innovative formulation excels in all weather conditions, making it ideal for use on wood, composite, and aluminum bats, as well as other sports equipment. Say goodbye to the hassle of traditional paper tube grip sticks; our Pro Wrap sticks come hand pre-wrapped in athletic tape, eliminating the need for additional wrapping. Simply tear back the tape to reveal the desired amount of Kraken, remove the tape, and you're ready to swing. Each Pro Wrap includes a custom, heavy metal engraved bottom for sturdy handling and a plastic pop-top Kraken carry case, offering convenient storage and protection for your gear without the need for flimsy plastic bags. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/118968\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
