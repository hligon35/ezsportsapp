  "description": "The EvoShield X-SRZ Savannah Bananas Elbow Guard offers enhanced protection with its 10% larger design compared to previous versions, ensuring increased coverage for athletes. Its ergonomic design allows for a personalized fit, maximizing impact protection with the innovative Gel-to-Shell® Technology, which transforms from a gel to a custom-molded shield in just 30 minutes. The guard effectively deflects and disperses impact with its advanced Dispersion Technology, while the custom molding gear ensures a unique, one-to-one fit for each player. Comfort is prioritized with a moisture-wicking interior lining and a stylish 3D Cloud Mesh exterior that adds a modern touch and surface structure. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/166232\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
