Built for slick infielders who want both flash and feel, this glove features the 1627 pattern with a medium to shallow pocket depth that’s perfect for quick transfers and clean glove work. The 11.5-inch length and I-Web design give you the control and confidence to dominate the dirt. With a navy, red, and tan colorway that pops on the field, and a lightweight yet durable Cordura shell backing, this glove is all about performance without the bulk. Whether you're turning two or flashing the leather, the Emerald Series brings the energy every inning. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/168131\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
