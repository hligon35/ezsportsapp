Featuring the 1786 pattern and an I-Web design, this glove ensures superior control and quick ball transfer. Its striking navy, purple, and teal colorway stands out on the field, while the SuperSnakeSkin backing offers unparalleled durability, being twice as strong as regular leather. Enhanced with Dri-Lex wrist lining for moisture-wicking comfort and flat finger binding for a more comfortable grip, this glove is designed to retain its shape over time with rolled dual welting. The conventional open back wrist type provides flexibility, making it a must-have for serious infielders. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/168835\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
