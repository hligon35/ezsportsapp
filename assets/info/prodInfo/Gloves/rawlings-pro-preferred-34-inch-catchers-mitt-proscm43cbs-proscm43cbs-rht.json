Crafted with flawless, supple kip leather, this mitt provides a perfect balance of durability and softness, ensuring it stands up to the rigors of the game. Its 100% wool padding is designed to enhance pocket formation and maintain the glove's shape, while the Pittards sheepskin lining efficiently wicks away moisture, keeping your hand cool and comfortable throughout intense games.
