This eye-catching glove features a sky blue, pink, and white colorway with a snakeskin print that brings serious style to your game. Built on the TSG-09 pattern with a medium pocket depth, it’s perfect for quick transfers and slick fielding across the infield. The one-piece web adds structure and control, while the 11.5-inch length is ideal for infielders who crave precision. With a classic conventional open back for a comfortable fit and just the right amount of flash, the Emerald Series Blush glove is where elite performance meets bold personality. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/168129\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
