Built for pitchers who want performance and personality, this glove features the ELS19 pattern with a medium pocket depth, perfect for hiding your grip and making slick plays. The two-piece web offers solid structure and ball concealment, while the 11.75-inch length gives you total control. Finished in a sleek black and grey colorway with eye-popping neon green accents and elephant print for added drip, this glove doesn’t just play hard — it looks the part. With a conventional open back and smooth feel, the Electric Mamba is ready to dominate the game in style. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/168134\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
