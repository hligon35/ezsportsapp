  "description": "The Wilson A2000 PF88 SuperSkin 11.25\" Infield Glove is a top choice for infield players seeking superior performance and style. Featuring an eye-catching black, sky blue, and neon yellow colorway, this glove combines the durability of Pro Stock Leather with the strength of SuperSkin backing, which is twice as strong as regular leather. Its I-Web design and 11.25-inch length make it ideal for quick plays and precise fielding. The glove's Pedroia Fit ensures a snug fit with a smaller wrist opening and finger stalls, while the Dri-Lex wrist lining offers ultra-breathable, moisture-wicking comfort. Enhanced with flat finger binding and rolled dual welting, this glove retains its shape and provides a comfortable feel, making it a must-have for serious infielders. function positionHandler() {\n    return {\n        top: 0,\n        updatePosition() {\n            this.$nextTick(() => {\n                let viewportCenter = window.innerHeight / 2,\n                    parent = this.$el.parentElement,\n                    parentCenter = parent.clientHeight / 2,\n                    blockHeight = this.$el.offsetHeight / 2\n                this.top = viewportCenter - blockHeight;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n} {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"acidAdvancedReportsAjax\": {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/betterbaseball.com\\/acid_acidreports\\/countViews\\/product\\/id\\/168828\\/\"}        }\n    } BALLPLAYERS KNOW.
