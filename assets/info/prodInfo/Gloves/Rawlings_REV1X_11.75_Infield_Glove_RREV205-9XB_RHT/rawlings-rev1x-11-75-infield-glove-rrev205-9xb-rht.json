Its closed-web design and 205 pattern offer a deep pocket and standard palm width, ensuring excellent control and comfort. Featuring a striking colorway of black, blue, and gold, this glove is both stylish and functional for players aged 13 and up. The U.S. steerhide leather construction, combined with an adaptive fit system and conventional open backing, ensures a snug fit and long-lasting durability.
