Twisted, knotted, UV-treated nylon keeps its pop through sun, rain, and heavy use—perfect for home setups and weekend warriors. Order today and we'll ship it fast and free—next business day.\n\nWARNING: This netting reduces risk but cannot eliminate it. Batted balls can ricochet and may still strike nearby players or coaches, potentially causing injury. Always use appropriate protective equipment and follow best-practice training protocols."
