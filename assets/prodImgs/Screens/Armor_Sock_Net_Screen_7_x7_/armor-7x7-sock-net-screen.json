  "description": "The Armor 7x7 Sock Screen offers exceptional durability at an affordable price. Featuring a 1 ⅝” industrial-grade powder-coated steel frame and #60 gauge poly double-layered pillowcase netting, this screen is designed to withstand heavy use and outlast the competition. Perfect for both on-field and in-facility use, it is ideal for hitting or throwing drills. You can customize the screen with your team’s colors and enhance its longevity by adding a heavy-duty foam and vinyl pad kit, which helps reduce batted ball ricochet and protects the life of your netting. WARNING: This screen is intended to protect the pitcher or nearby players during batting practice or practice drills. However, it is possible a batted ball may ricochet off the screen and hit the batter or a nearby player, causing serious injury or even death. Batters, pitchers, and nearby players should always wear appropriate protective equipment while using this product.
