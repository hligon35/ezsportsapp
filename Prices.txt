Admin dashboard — user manual tutorial

Purpose
Use the admin.html dashboard to manage products, invoices, orders, users, marketing, finance, and traffic analytics.

Before you start
- You need an admin account.
- Server admin routes are protected by requireAdmin.
- If calling admin APIs directly, ensure your admin session cookie or an admin bearer token is present.

Sign in
1) Open admin.html on your site.
2) Sign in with an admin email/password.
3) You will see the dashboard navigation for all sections.

Navigation
- Sidebar: Products, Invoices, Orders, Users, Marketing, Finance, Traffic.
- Filters/Actions: Most pages include filters and a Refresh/Sync button.

Common best practices
- Use Dry run for product sync before committing changes.
- Only enable Deactivate removed when you are ready to remove items in Stripe.
- Use timeframe filters to narrow data for Finance and Traffic.
- Confirm you are using the correct Stripe environment (test vs live).

Section guides and workflows

Products
What it does
- Imports/updates your local catalog from your source of truth and helps keep Stripe in sync.

Typical workflows
- Preview changes (Dry run):
  1) Open Products.
  2) Select Dry run.
  3) Run Product Sync to preview creates/updates/deletes without applying.
- Apply changes:
  1) Open Products.
  2) Ensure Dry run is OFF.
  3) (Optional) Enable Deactivate removed to disable products that no longer exist.
  4) Run Product Sync and review results.

Tips
- Resolve SKU/code mismatches before applying.
- Keep Deactivate removed off until you’ve verified the preview looks correct.

Invoices (Stripe Invoicing)
What it does
- Lets you view recent Stripe invoices (if you use Stripe Invoicing).

Typical workflows
- Review invoices:
  1) Open Invoices.
  2) Set a Status filter (e.g., draft, open, paid).
  3) Click Refresh to load matching invoices.

Orders
What it does
- Shows local orders and their statuses.

Typical workflows
- Check order status:
  1) Open Orders.
  2) Locate the order.
  3) Review its current status and details.

Users
What it does
- Launches Stripe Billing Portal on behalf of a customer.

Typical workflows
- Open a customer’s Billing Portal:
  1) Open Users.
  2) Enter the customer’s email.
  3) Click to launch the Billing Portal session.

Marketing
What it does
- Displays KPIs, lists coupons/subscribers, creates coupons, and queues newsletters.

Typical workflows
- Review KPIs:
  1) Open Marketing.
  2) Review top metrics for quick health checks.
- Manage coupons:
  1) Open Marketing → Coupons.
  2) List existing coupons or create a new one.
- Queue a newsletter:
  1) Open Marketing → Newsletters.
  2) Draft content and schedule/queue for send.

Finance
What it does
- Summarizes Stripe performance and cash flow.

Typical workflows
- Review Stripe summary:
  1) Open Finance.
  2) Set timeframe filters.
  3) Review Gross, Refunds, Fees, Net, Balance, Payouts, and Invoices.

Traffic
What it does
- Provides Cloudflare analytics.

Typical workflows
- Analyze traffic:
  1) Open Traffic.
  2) Review requests, cache hit %, bandwidth, and threats.
  3) Check Top paths, and trends by day and country for insights.

Troubleshooting
- Access denied or 401:
  - You are not authenticated as admin. Sign out and back in with an admin account, or attach an admin token for API calls.
- Empty data:
  - Adjust filters and timeframe. Confirm Stripe/Cloudflare credentials and environment.
- Product sync errors:
  - Fix duplicate/missing SKUs, correct pricing, and rerun with Dry run first.
- API rate or sync issues:
  - Retry after a short delay. Reduce the time window or batch size if available.

Security notes
- Do not share admin access or tokens.
- Revoke unused tokens and sign out when done.

Health endpoints (server):
- GET /health — basic health check
- GET /health/emails — queued/sending/failed emails with retry info

Notes: Admin API routes are protected by requireAdmin on the server. Ensure your admin session or token is configured before calling them directly.
